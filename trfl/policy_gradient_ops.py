        concatenation leaves shape just equal to batch shape).

  Given a (possible nested structure of) batch(es) of policies, this
  calculates the total entropy and corrects the sign so that minimizing the

  This function accepts a nested structure of `policies` in order to allow for
  multiple distribution types or for multiple action dimensions in the case
  where there is no corresponding mutivariate form for available for a given
  univariate distribution. In this case, the loss is `sum_i(H(p_i, p_i))`
  where `p_i` are members of the `policies` nest. It can be shown that this is
  equivalent to calculating the entropy loss on the Cartesian product space
  over all the action dimensions, if the sampled actions are independent.

  The entropy loss is optionally scaled by some function of the policies.
  E.g. for Categorical distributions there exists such a scaling which maps
  the entropy loss into the range `[-1, 0]` in order to make it invariant to
  the size of the action space - specifically one can divide the loss by
  `sum_i(log(A_i))` where `A_i` is the number of categories in the i'th

  """Constructs a TensorFlow graph computing the A2C/GAE loss for sequences.

  This loss jointly learns the policy and the baseline. Therefore, gradients
  for this loss flow through each tensor in `policies` and through each tensor
  in `baseline_values`, but no other input tensors. The policy is learnt with
  the advantage actor-critic loss, plus an optional entropy term. The baseline
  is regressed towards the n-step bootstrapped returns given by the
  reward/pcontinue sequence. The `baseline_cost` parameter scales the
  gradients w.r.t the baseline relative to the policy gradient, i.e.
  d(loss) / d(baseline) = baseline_cost * (n_step_return - baseline)`.

  This function is designed for batches of sequences of data. Tensors are
  assumed to be time major (i.e. the outermost dimension is time, the second
  outermost dimension is the batch dimension). We denote the sequence length in
  the shapes of the arguments with the variable `T`, the batch size with the
  variable `B`, neither of which needs to be known at construction time. Index
  `0` of the time dimension is assumed to be the start of the sequence.

  `rewards` and `pcontinues` are the sequences of data taken directly from the
  environment, possibly modulated by a discount. `baseline_values` are the
  sequences of (typically learnt) estimates of the values of the states
  visited along a batch of trajectories as observed by the agent given the
  sequences of one or more actions sampled from `policies`.

  The sequences in the tensors should be aligned such that an agent in a state
  with value `V` that takes an action `a` transitions into another state
  with value `V'`, receiving reward `r` and pcontinue `p`. Then `V`, `a`, `r`
  and `p` are all at the same index `i` in the corresponding tensors. `V'` is
  at index `i+1`, or in the `bootstrap_value` tensor if `i == T`.

  For n-dimensional action vectors, a multivariate distribution must be used
  for `policies`. In case there is no multivariate version for the desired
  univariate distribution, or in case the `actions` object is a nested
  structure (e.g. for multiple action types), this function also accepts a
  nested structure  of `policies`. In this case, the loss is given by
  `sum_i(loss(p_i, a_i))` where `p_i` are members of the `policies` nest, and
  `a_i` are members of the `actions` nest. We assume that a single baseline is
  used across all action dimensions for each timestep.

    policies: A (possibly nested structure of) distribution(s) supporting
        `batch_shape` and `event_shape` properties & `log_prob` and `entropy`

        with `batch_shape` equal to `[T, B]`. E.g. for a (non-nested) diagonal
        multivariate gaussian with dimension `A` this would be:
        `policies = tfp.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiag(mus, sigmas)`
        where `mus` and `sigmas` have shape `[T, B, A]`.

        shape `[T, B]`.
    actions: A (possibly nested structure of) N-D Tensor(s) with shape
        `[T, B, ...]` where the final dimensions are the `event_shape` of the
        corresponding distribution in the nested structure (the shape can be
        just `[T, B]` if the `event_shape` is scalar).
    rewards: 2-D Tensor with shape `[T, B]`.
    pcontinues: 2-D Tensor with shape `[T, B]`.
    bootstrap_value: 1-D Tensor with shape `[B]`.
    policy_vars: An optional (possibly nested structure of) iterables of
        Tensors used by `policies`. If provided is used in scope checks. For
        the multivariate normal example above this would be `[mus, sigmas]`.
    lambda_: an optional scalar or 2-D Tensor with shape `[T, B]` for
        Generalised Advantage Estimation as per
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438.
    entropy_cost: optional scalar cost that pushes the policy to have high
        entropy, larger values cause higher entropies.
    baseline_cost: scalar cost that scales the derivatives of the baseline
        relative to the policy gradient.
    entropy_scale_op: An optional op that takes `policies` as its only
