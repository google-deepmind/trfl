  """Retrace algorithm loss calculation op.

  Given a minibatch of temporally-contiguous sequences of Q values, policy
  probabilities, and various other typical RL algorithm inputs, this
  Op creates a subgraph that computes a loss according to the
  Retrace multi-step off-policy value learning algorithm. This Op supports the
  use of target networks, but does not require them.

  For more details of Retrace, refer to
  [the arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02647).

  In argument descriptions, `T` counts the number of transitions over which
  the Retrace loss is computed, and `B` is the minibatch size. Note that all
  tensor arguments list a first-dimension (time dimension) size of T+1;
  this is because in order to compute the loss over T timesteps, the
  algorithm must be aware of the values of many of its inputs at timesteps
  before and after each transition.

  All tensor arguments are indexed first by transition, with specific
  details of this indexing in the argument descriptions.

  Args:
    lambda_: Positive scalar value or 0-D `Tensor` controlling the degree to
      which future timesteps contribute to the loss computed at each
      transition.
    qs: 3-D tensor holding per-action Q-values for the states encountered
      just before taking the transitions that correspond to each major index.
      Since these values are the predicted values we wish to update (in other
      words, the values we intend to change as we learn), in a target network
      setting, these nearly always come from the "non-target" network, which
      we usually call the "learning network".
      Shape is `[(T+1), B, num_actions]`.
    targnet_qs: Like `qs`, but in the target network setting, these values
      should be computed by the target network. We use these values to
      compute multi-step error values for timesteps that follow the first
      timesteps in each sequence and sequence fragment we consider.
      Shape is `[(T+1), B, num_actions]`.
    actions: 2-D tensor holding the indices of actions executed during the
      transition that corresponds to each major index.
      Shape is `[(T+1), B]`.
    rewards: 2-D tensor holding rewards received during the transition
      that corresponds to each major index.
      Shape is `[(T+1), B]`.
    pcontinues: 2-D tensor holding pcontinue values received during the
      transition that corresponds to each major index.
      Shape is `[(T+1), B]`.
    target_policy_probs: 3-D tensor holding per-action policy probabilities
      for the states encountered just before taking the transitions that
      correspond to each major index, according to the target policy (i.e.
      the policy we wish to learn). These probabilities usually derive from
      the learning net.
      Shape is `[(T+1), B, num_actions]`.
    behaviour_policy_probs: 2-D tensor holding the *behaviour* policy's
      probabilities of having taken actions `action` during the transitions
      that correspond to each major index. These probabilities derive from
      whatever policy you used to generate the data.
      Shape is `[(T+1), B]`.
    stop_targnet_gradients: `bool` that enables a sensible default way of
      handling gradients through the Retrace op (essentially, gradients
      are not permitted to involve the `targnet_qs` inputs). Can be disabled
      if you require a different arrangement, but you'll probably want to
      block some gradients somewhere.

  `target_policy_t` is the policy that this function aims to evaluate. New

  ```none
  T(x_{t-1}, a_{t-1}) = r_t + Œ≥[ ùîº_œÄ Q(x_t, .) - c_t Q(x_t, a_t) +

  ```
  `T(x_t, a_t)` is an estimate of expected discounted future returns based
  on the current Q value estimates `Q(x_t, a_t)` and rewards `r_t`. The
  evaluated target values can be used as supervised targets for learning the Q
  function itself or as returns for various policy gradient algorithms.
  `Q==T` if convergence is reached. As the formula is recurrent, it will
  evaluate multistep returns for non-zero importance weights `c_t`.

  In the usual moving and target network setup `q_t` should be calculated by
  the target network while the `target_policy_t` may be evaluated by either of
  the networks. If `target_policy_t` is evaluated by the current moving network
  the algorithm implemented will have a similar flavour as double DQN.

  Depending on the choice of c_t, the algorithm can implement:
  ```none

  Harutyunyan's et al. Q(lambda)  c_t = Œª,

  Given a minibatch of temporally-contiguous sequences of Q values, policy
  probabilities, and various other typical RL algorithm inputs, this
  Op creates a subgraph that computes a loss according to the
  Retrace multi-step off-policy value learning algorithm. This Op supports the
  use of target networks, but does not require them.

  This function is the "core" Retrace op only because its arguments are less
  user-friendly and more implementation-convenient. For a more user-friendly
  operator, consider using `retrace`. For more details of Retrace, refer to
  [the arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02647).

  Construct the "core" retrace loss subgraph for a batch of sequences.

  Note that two pairs of arguments (one holding target network values; the
  other, actions) are temporally-offset versions of each other and will share
  many values in common (nb: a good setting for using `IndexedSlices`). *This
  op does not include any checks that these pairs of arguments are
  consistent*---that is, it does not ensure that temporally-offset
  arguments really do share the values they are supposed to share.

  In argument descriptions, `T` counts the number of transitions over which
  the Retrace loss is computed, and `B` is the minibatch size. All tensor
  arguments are indexed first by transition, with specific details of this
  indexing in the argument descriptions (pay close attention to "subscripts"
  in variable names).

      which future timesteps contribute to the loss computed at each
      transition.

      from whatever policy you used to generate the data. All values MUST be
      greater that 0. Shape is `[T, B]`.
    targnet_q_t: 3-D tensor holding per-action Q-values for the states
      encountered just AFTER taking the transitions that correspond to each
      major index. Since these values are used to calculate target values for
      the network, in a target in a target network setting, these should

    stop_targnet_gradients: `bool` that enables a sensible default way of
      handling gradients through the Retrace op (essentially, gradients
      are not permitted to involve the `targnet_q_t` input).
      Can be disabled if you require a different arragement, but
